Tensors are basically TensorFlow's version of a Numpy array with a few differences that make them better suited to deep learning. One of the most important is that tensors are compatible with [GPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage) and [TPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu)) accelerators. TPUs, in fact, are designed specifically for tensor computations.\n\nA model's weights are kept in its `weights` attribute as a list of tensors. Get the weights of the model you defined above. (If you want, you could display the weights with something like: `print(\"Weights\\n{}\\n\\nBias\\n{}\".format(w, b))`).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# YOUR CODE HERE\nw, b = model.weights\n\n# Check your answer\nq_3.check()","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":0,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_3.hint()","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":0},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(By the way, Keras represents weights as tensors, but also uses tensors to represent data. When you set the `input_shape` argument, you are telling Keras the dimensions of the array it should expect for each example in the training data. Setting `input_shape=[3]` would create a network accepting vectors of length 3, like `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6]`.)\n \n\n# Optional: Plot the output of an untrained linear model\n \nThe kinds of problems we'll work on through Lesson 5 will be *regression* problems, where the goal is to predict some numeric target. Regression problems are like \"curve-fitting\" problems: we're trying to find a curve that best fits the data. Let's take a look at the \"curve\" produced by a linear model. (You've probably guessed that it's a line!)\n \nWe mentioned that before training a model's weights are set randomly.
