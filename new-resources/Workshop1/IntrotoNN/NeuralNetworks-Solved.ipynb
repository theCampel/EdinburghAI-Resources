    "### Loss Function 📉 \n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, you need 2 things: a **loss function** and an **optimiser**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loss function decides how good a job your model did. The lower it is the better. Through training, the loss should go down, indicating that the model is getting better at the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the lecture we had an input of 1 and a desired output of 2. We ran the model and got an output of 0. We could score this with a loss function of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Loss}(\\text{model output}, \\text{desired output}) = |\\text{model output} - \\text{desired output}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "or in more mathematical language:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{L}(\\hat{y}, y) = |\\hat{y} - y|$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is the desired output and $\\hat{y}$ is the model's guess\n",

    "\n",
    "*Hint: Imagine the absolute value wasn't there. What would happen if the model outputted 5 and you wanted it to output 10?*\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real world example, if we wanted our model to predict the next word, we could define a loss function that scores 0 if the next word is correct and 1 if it is incorrect. Minimising this would mean that the model always outputs the correct next word - ideal! This is not conceptually too far from what is actually done in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimiser 🏋️‍♀️\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimiser decides how to change the parameters of the model to do a better job next time. After the loss has been calculated, it goes in and updates the parameters in the model so that the model gets closer to the desired output. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by going backwards through the model, looking at each parameter, and seeing whether you should increase or decrease that parameter in order to make the loss smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimiser doesn't just look at the direction, it also looks at how much to change each parameter by. It does this by determining how sensitive the loss is to changes of each parameter. For math nerds: it does this using derivatives and the chain rule i.e. the gradient of the loss function w.r.t the parameter. It also multiplies this number by a *learning rate* which is generally set to somewhere between 0.01 and 0.00001, depending on the task, model and loss function. This is a *hyperparameter.* of our NN - it's set by you to guide the ML algorithm to do a better job.\n",
